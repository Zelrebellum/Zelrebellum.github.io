        <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
        <div id="wrapper">
        <h2>Teeth: The Organ of Evolutionary Confusion</h2>
        <p>Encapsulating concepts of, Natural Selection, Specification, Co-evolution, and Pleiotropy</p>
        <p>Focusing on mammals with inclusion of vertebrate relations.</p>
        <p>[Sentance claim to support]</p>
        <br>
        <p>The planned format is a website focusing on the condensing and accessibility of information about the topic.
            Providing clear information, with supporting visuals to help comprehension of the subject
             matter. Ideally, I would like it to be informative, but slightly playful, to keep 
             the reader engaged and provide additional help for comprehension. 
             Accessibility of information and alternative learning styles is very important
              to me as someone who struggles with learning.</p>

    <h3>Key points of discussion are as follows:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Unknown Origin, but there are Theories</b> 
            <ul>
                <li>Teeth have conflicting theories of origin and are something that has confused 
                    scientists. I plan to break down researcher’s different theories in addition 
                    to some general history of teeth to use as an introduction. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Let’s get Down to Basics … Basic Structures</b>
            <ul>
                <li>While structures of teeth vary from different species, 
                    there are still core structures that will be mentioned. 
                    This section will provide more visuals and definition like segments the 
                    reader can come back to if needed. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Tooth Complexity and its Leading to Diversification</b>
            <ul>
                <li>Likely the largest section. This is where the majority of my information and 
                    interests were found. This is what the previous sections were preparing for. 
                    Ideally another visual heavy section, but that may be out of scope for the project.</li>
                <li>Likely subsections of this section will bring in more species-specific history.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><b>Interactions and Relations with other Structures</b>
            <ul>
                <li>This section will talk about teeth in relation to mostly jaws and tastebuds. 
                    Teeth are part of a system, so talking about that relationship provides well 
                    roundedness in the information and acts as a good conclusion to wrap up the topic. </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Scope and Other Remarks</h3>
    <p>With many projects I tend to over scope, burn out trying to achieve that scope, 
        and end up not being entirely proud of what I finished at the end. 
        This is something that I do when I have a smaller class load, so it is somewhat possible. 
        My initial scope for the project is going to start small, focusing on condensing all the 
        information in a format I think is best for achieving my purpose of the website. 
        Then I want to work on appropriate and helpful visuals, something that’ll help the content make 
        sense, not just something that looks pretty. Lastly, making the website look pretty. 
        It is not something that is required but something that is very helpful but is also time 
        consuming. I don’t want to get lost in the details when all the information isn’t there, which 
        is why I am putting this last. Teeth and how they differ across species is something that is 
        really interesting to me, so I tried to find articles related to that AND evolution. 
        So, my topic is more of an overview on information which has me slightly worried. 
        This will also be my first time writing anything like this so there is a lot of new for me. 
        (which is another reason why I am keeping my scope small, so it’ll at least be done well) 
        <br><br>The hardest part of the proposal for note is the title. I think it is a little misleading 
        to what I will be talking about. Title creation is also the hardest part of projects for me, 
        so this is definitely just a working title. Secondly, is the claim. I have goals that 
        I want to achieve with the website as a whole, and a lot of that focuses on the delivery of 
        information that isn’t able to fit into a claim easily. So, I am worried that I will need to 
        change that and possibly get some help. </p>
